You can choose any number from 1 to 500 in this game. 
Points are calculated based on the difference between the two numbers. 
If the computer guesses your number, it gains 100 points.
For every points apart from your number, the points the computer gains drops by one. 
If the difference is above 100 but below 200, you gain points equivalent to 200 minus the difference.
For example, if the difference is 25, the computer gains 75 points. If the difference is 150, the player gains 50 points.
If the difference is 200 or more, no one gets points. 
At any point, you can type "q" instead of a number to quit the game. 
Otherwise, the game ends when one player gets 300 points.
The computer will continue to learn based on what the opponent chooses. 
After a game ends, you can rematch the computer.
If you do, you can either choose to reset its data or keep its information about the previous game.
